Just some helpful notes until I have time to provide more detailed tutorials / guides:

- **Check out the examples folder**   
	There are a bunch of *.qml* files located at **res/examples/qml** to showcase and test functionality of some **[VTK](http://www.vtk.org)** classes. You can load a file, edit stuff in the editor and recompile your changes to get a feeling for how things work.
	
- **Editor Shortcuts**    
	The code editor is <del>garbage</del> very alpha. You'll notice when opening or closing brackets. But whatever, you can at least use shortcuts:
	- `cmd` + `N`: new file
	- `cmd` + `O`: open file
	- `cmd` + `S`: save file
	- `cmd` + `R`: compile and run
	
- **Use the type browser**   
	The search bar in the application's upper-right corner allows you to search for types available in QuickVtk. You can quickly get an overview of all properties, methods and some other useful meta information of any type this way.

- **Knowing VTK can be helpful**    
	There are some concepts in **[VTK](http://www.vtk.org)** that take some getting used to. You can familiarize by either looking at the examples located at **res/examples/qml** or examples and documentation on the **[VTK](http://www.vtk.org)** website.
